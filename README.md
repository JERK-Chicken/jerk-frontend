**JERK Chicken:**

The group consisting of James Bell, Logan Gantner, Eric Last, and Robert 
Comstock III were presented with the task of creating a web app using the 
technologies that we have learned up to this point. After brainstorming, we 
sought to develop an app that allows the user to locate recipes based on the
contents of their fridge. This would prevent the user of repeated seraches 
when they realize that the recipe they found requires ingredients that they
don't possess. Beyond the search ability, we also wanted to allow user the 
ability to save recipes that they have previously enjoyed:

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

After deciding on a project idea, we immediately sorted ourselves into the roles
we would be best at to create the best product possible. The roles are as follows
- Logan Gantner: Team Lead. Conducted daily standups, delegated responsibilities, and was a liaison between back and front end
- Eric Last: Back End Lead. Head of backend development, oversaw implementation of backend functionality and endpoints 
- Robert Comstock III: Front End Lead. In charge of page desing and layout, testing, and functionality
- James Bell: Set up databases and assisted build of functionality and endpoints

**Working as a Team**

To outline our project we used Trello to lay out story points and develop burndown chart. 
We made sure to have consistent communication by having daily standups to make sure everyone 
was properly up to date on their schedule and any problems they may have been accounting.
To work on the project we broke into two teams to tackle both the front and back end with some 
members assisting either team when necessary. We were able to work seemlessly by maintining 
necessary documentation and communication throughout the project. 

**Non-User**

Our vision for our webpage was to be client friendly. We wanted to allow anyone the 
ability to use our application, but limit certain functionality to users and admin. 
As an individual who is not logged into our app, you are still able to access 
recipes from the database based on the ingredients you entered. If you want to save 
a recipe that you enjoyed, then you would have to register an account which would then 
allow you access to more functionality. 

**User**

Beyond the ability to save a recipe, a user also has the ability to create new 
recipes, manage their existing recipes, and delete recipes that they no longer 
want representing them. The user has the ability to perform all of these functions 
on their Dashboard. On the dashboard, the user is also able to view their own 
information, their saved recipes, and all of the recipes they have created. Once 
the user has accomplished all of their desired tasks, they can log out and go about 
their merry way!

**The App**

Our webpage has two main pages with some bonus pages that branch off of those two 
to allow the user added functionality. The Home Page and the User Dashboard.
